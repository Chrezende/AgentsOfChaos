A campestri moves by manipulating the mycelium that grows out of the base of its stem and supports it. The mushroom creatures eat salty soil, filter out the salt, and excrete a slippery paste of purified soil (stripped of things nourishing to fungi, of course). Eating salt is also a defense mechanism, because it makes the campestris taste salty and thus unpleasant to most creatures, though bullywugs consider them a delicacy."
